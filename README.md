# Pooling-Filter-Combinational-Design-Project
This was a Verilog intensive project I completed as a part of ECE M16 - Digital Logic Design.

The goal of this project is design a digital circuit that implements a common type of image filter known as a pooling filter (also known as a pooling layer). This type of filter is employed to reduce the size of an input image while keeping relevant features of the input and discarding irrelevant in- formation, such as noise. Pooling layers are an essential component of convolutional neural networks as they allow models to learn relations between distant regions of the input image, which is necessary for most modern computer vision applications.

The project deliverables folder contains the blank skeleton template code give in the class. The result folder has the final, implemented verilog files required to implement the logic for the pooling filter.
